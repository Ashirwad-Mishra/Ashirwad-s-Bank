## Features:
- **Account Management**: Create, View, and Close accounts
- **Deposit and Withdrawal**: Handle deposits and withdrawals with a minimum balance check
- **File Handling**: Save and retrieve account details from a file for persistence
- **Exception Handling**: Prevent withdrawal below the minimum balance limit

## Technologies Used:
- **C++**
- **OOP** (Classes, Objects)
- **File Handling** (ifstream, ofstream)
- **STL** (map for account storage)
- **Exception Handling** (for managing insufficient funds)
